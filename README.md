Welcome to the RPG Character Builder Version 1. This is a simple character customization app that allows you to build a custom hero from a set of pre-established choices. Design your hero by choosing their race, their class, and their weapon choice, as well as a name of your choosing. Save your creation to a database of heroes, and view your creations at any time. You have the power to both edit your heroes and erase them from existence all together. Begin your creation process here: https://quirky-heisenberg-45af30.netlify.com/.
